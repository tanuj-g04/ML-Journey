# 🧠 ML Journey

A personal repository documenting my step-by-step learning of Machine Learning through experiments with different models.

The goal is not dataset performance — it is understanding **how models behave, fail, and improve**.

## Implemented Models

### Decision Tree — `titanic-dt.ipynb`

* Model interpretability
* Depth vs overfitting
* Bias–variance intuition

**Key idea:** Trees easily memorize data but generalize poorly without control.

---

### Neural Network (Regularized) — `titanic_nn_regularized.ipynb`

* Training dynamics
* Overfitting in neural networks
* L2 regularization and generalization

**Key idea:** Neural networks learn capacity; regularization limits memorization.

---

### Digit Recognition — `digit_recog.ipynb`

* Feature learning vs manual features
* Why deep learning works for images

**Key idea:** When patterns become spatial, representation learning becomes necessary.
